* Clops-Gui

A system that uses cl-gtk4 and allows other apps to use its GUI capabilities for
drawing canvas, menu and events. Quite limited subset of Gtk4 capabilities has
been implemented, but it may be enough for simple 2D graphics or games.

So far it can only do multiple windows that contain only one widget, that is
DrawingArea. The examples folder will contain examples of using the system.

There is a limitation https://github.com/bohonghuang/cl-gtk4/issues/58 of what
the underlying library can do, so you may have to implement your own widget
system similar to those in Smalltalk systems.

Perhaps it would be possible to have a declarative way to define other widgets
than DrawingArea, in similar manner to function ~menu-bar-menu~ is used for menu,
but that is not my priority.

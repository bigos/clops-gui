* Clops-Gui

A system that uses cl-gtk4 and allows other apps to use its GUI capabilities for
drawing canvas, menu and events. Quite limited subset of Gtk4 capabilities has
been implemented, but it may be enough for simple 2D graphics or games.

So far it can only do multiple windows that contain only one widget, that is
DrawingArea. The examples folder will contain examples of using the system.

There is a limitation https://github.com/bohonghuang/cl-gtk4/issues/58 of what
the underlying library can do, so you may have to implement your own widget
system similar to those in Smalltalk systems.

Perhaps it would be possible to have a declarative way to define other widgets
than DrawingArea, in similar manner to function ~menu-bar-menu~ is used for menu,
but that is not my priority.

** Usage

To run a simple counter evaluate:
#+begin_src lisp
  (load "~/Programming/Lisp/clops-gui/examples/boxes-new.lisp")
#+end_src

** Installation

You need SBCL, quicklisp and ultralisp. Please follow the relevant instructions.

also install development libraries

#+begin_example
sudo apt install libgtk-4-dev
#+end_example

** coding conventions

discussion about prepending functions with %
https://www.reddit.com/r/Common_Lisp/comments/jgj9lu/naming_conventions/

And some programmers will name particularly low-level functions with names that start with % or even %%.

*** linting
 not so good, rather disappointing

#+begin_example
CL-USER> (ql:quickload :sblint)
CL-USER> (sblint:run-lint-directory "~/Programming/Lisp/clops-gui/")
#+end_example

** Interesting Gtk doc

*** Drawing model
https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/drawing-model.html

**** event
Some events, like mouse motion are compressed so that only a single mouse motion event per clock cycle

**** update
running animation

**** layout
geometry changes, sizes and positions

**** paint
redrawing what needs redrawing

*** file requester
Because of horrible documentation in Gtk4 I will need to implement my own file
requester, possibly being inspired by Emacs

** Great ideas

*** Archy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archy_(software)

#+begin_quote
Archy has been compared as similar to the Emacs text editor, although its design
begins from a clean slate.
#+end_quote

** source registry config
file:~/.config/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/

#+begin_src lisp
(:tree #P"/home/jacek/Programming/Lisp/")
#+end_src

** notes

*** moving to app
file:~/Programming/Lisp/lispy-experiments/window-canvas/src/window-canvas.lisp::1


file:~/Programming/Lisp/clops-gui/examples/example.lisp::1

*** remove gui-box from gui-window
[[file:src/gui-window.lisp::(defmethod add-child]] and the method below need to be
somehow moved to gui-box

*** inspiration
file:~/Programming/Lisp/lispy-experiments/window-canvas-boxes/notes.org::1

*** testing example
file:~/Programming/Lisp/clos-sweeper/tests/
[[file:~/Programming/Lisp/clos-sweeper/clos-sweeper.asd::(asdf:defsystem #:clos-sweeper/tests]]

*** testing
file:~/Programming/Lisp/clops-gui/tests/terminal-test-loader.lisp::1

#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload :clops-gui/tests)
(asdf:test-system :clops-gui/tests)
#+end_src
